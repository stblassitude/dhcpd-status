# ISC DHCPD Leases as an HTML Page

This simple Python Bottle app reads ISC DHCPDs leases file and formats it
as a simple HTML page. Reading the leases file is accomplished through
https://github.com/MartijnBraam/python-isc-dhcp-leases.

I wrote this using Python 3; it might well work with Python 2, but I haven't
tested that.
